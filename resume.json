He's attentive to feedback and asks for it when he needs it, reads a lot of both online and dead tree literature, and can grasp concepts that are far beyond his practical experience. \nHe has both breath, depth and strikes a healthy balance between quality and speed in his work. So whatever his future brings I know he will be highly valued on the merits of his work. \r\nAs a personal note even though he works hard, he's a pretty chill introvert with a sense of humor, and will be pleasure to be around for anyone."
